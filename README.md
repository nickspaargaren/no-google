# Definition of GAFAM
*The GAFAM is an acronym used to describe the five multinational technology companies Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, taking the first letters of all these companies. The GAFAM are sometimes referred to as the Big Five due to them being the five most profilific companies in the world. Although in some sectors some of the five companies may be in direct competition, they offer different products or services overall while presenting some common characteristics that deserve to bring them together under the same acronym: by their size, they are particularly influential on the American and European Internet both economically and politically and socially and are regularly the subject of criticism or prosecution on tax matters, abuses of dominant positions and the non-respect of Internet users' privacy.*

# Purge Google from your network!

Protect yourself from Google's surveillance by using this blocklist!

Feel free to criticize our blocklist to make it better and better.
Suggestions are completely welcomed!


## Youtube Advertisements Regex
>_^r.+\googlevideo.com$_

NOTE: This is supposed to prevent these domains to be
loaded not only on youtube, but on all over the web and,
since I'm trying to completely block google in my home,
I don't care if youtube is broken.
I'll may work on an efficient regex for this purpose.

## Regex filters
>.?ampproject.

>.?android.

>.?chromeexperiments.

>.?doubleclick.

>.?firebaseio.

>.?google.

>.?googleapis.

>.?googlesyndication.

>.?googletagmanager.

>.?googletagservices.

>.?googleusercontent.

>.?gstatic.

>.?google-analytics.

>.?waze.

>.?withgoogle.

>.?youtube.  

>.?1e100.

>.?googlebot.

>.?gmodules.

## Sites you may want to whitelist
### Captcha
>`www.google.com`

>`www.gstatic.com`

>recaptcha.google.com

Note: Stock android have a data leak to `www.google.com`.

Since browser will be exposed to presumably malicious code, appropriate countermeasures should be utilized, such as `privacy.firstparty.isolate`, `privacy.resistFingerprinting` and `CanvasBlocker`.

### G APIs
>ajax.googleapis.com

Without the APIs major ammout of web sites will be broken. `Decentraleyes` browser extension could solve the issue without whitelisting the subdomain, but not for all sites.

### Fonts
>fonts.google.com

## How to use it ?
Simply go into to your blocklist settings to add either, the whole filter `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/pihole-google.txt
or either a selection of the filtered domains 
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/youtubeparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/shortlinksparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/proxiesparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/productsparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/mailparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/generalparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/fontsparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/firebaseparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/doubleclickparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/domainsparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/dnsparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/androidparsed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickspaargaren/pihole-google/master/categories/analyticsparsed
```

(Combining those with the main whole filter is useless and not recommended, however, feel free to combine the different smaller filters)
